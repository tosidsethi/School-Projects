**Description:**
This coding project was part of a series of analyses of [Goldbeter's 1995 model](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8587874) for the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) circadian clock.  The effects of different parameter sets on the performance of Goldbeter's 1995 model were observed, subsequent to a survey of evolutionary algorithms.  

Four different types of evolutionary algorithms were analyzed, including a genetic algorithm with tournament selection, a genetic algorithm with linear ranking selection, an evolutionary strategy with truncation selection, and a genetic algorithm with proportional selection. In all cases except for the evolutionary strategy, the algorithms were run with 40 parents, 40 children, and an elite count of 1. The evolutionary strategy was run with 8 parents, 40 children, and an elite count of 0.  All algorithms were run assuming uniform crossover and a mutation fraction of 0.05. The tournament size for tournament selection was 2.
