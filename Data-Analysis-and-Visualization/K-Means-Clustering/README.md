**Programming Language(s):** Python

**Collaborator(s):** Peter Graham, Bruce Maxwell

**Description:**
A demonstration of the K-means clustering algorithm.
	
To run: 
1. In terminal, cd to directory and type "python cLuster_new.py". 

2. Select File->Open, then use the clustertest.dat file as a sample data file.

3. Run the clustering algorithm on the data by selecting Command->Run K-means Clustering Algorithm.  You will be prompted for an initial cluster count (e.g., 4) and number of iterations (e.g., 10).  When the program is finished, the data points should be colored according to how the program grouped the data into clusters.

4. Manipulate the data as follows:
	TRANSLATE: Click and drag the left mouse button.
	ZOOM: Hold middle mouse button and move your mouse up (zoom in) or down (zoom out).
	3-D ROTATE: Click and drag the right mouse button.
